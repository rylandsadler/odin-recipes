    <h1>Garlicky Turkish Couscous Bowls</h1>
    <img src="/images/couscous_bowls.webp">
    <p>Lemony couscous is the ideal base for this hearty, wholesome, vegetarian meal. It's topped with spiced roasted vegetables—like crispy-edged broccoli and tender tomatoes—and a dollop of creamy hummus, making a delicious bounty in a bowl! A drizzle of a garlicky lemon sauce completes the dish with a citrusy, zesty punch.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Broccoli</li>    
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>    
    <li>Lemon</li>    
    <li>Mushroom Stock Concentrate</li>     
    <li>Tomato</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Cooking Oil</li>
    <li>Couscous</li>
    <li>Feta Cheese (1/2 Cup)</li>
    <li>Sour Cream (1.5 TBPS)</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Turkish Spice Blend (1TPSB)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces. Cut tomatoes lengthwise into quarters. Zest and quarter lemon.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In a large bowl, gently toss broccoli and tomatoes with a large drizzle of oil, stock concentrate, Turkish Spice Blend, half the garlic powder (you'll use the rest later), a small pinch of salt, and pepper. Transfer veggies to a baking sheet and roast on middle rack until browned and tender, 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>While veggies roast, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add couscous; cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted, 1-2 minutes. Stir in 1½ cups water (2½ cups for 4) and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Cook until couscous is tender, 8-10 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream with juice from two lemon wedges (four wedges for 4 servings). Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt to taste.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Once couscous is done, stir in a pinch of lemon zest; fluff with a fork. Divide couscous between bowls and top with veggies and hummus. Drizzle garlicky lemon sauce over veggies and serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side. </li>
</ol>
