<h1>Melty Mozz & Mushroom Panini</h1>
<img src="/images/mozz.webp">
<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever loved a hot, crisp panini sandwich in your life, you’ll go wild for this one. You’ll swipe savory garlic mayo over sourdough slices, fill with herby sautéed mushrooms, then top with easy-melting mozzarella before it hits a hot pan for that ultra-cheese-stretchy finish everyone’s always photographing (hint, hint!). Nobody likes a lonely sammie, though—pair yours with crispy roasted potato wedges to complete this hearty vegetarian meal that simply can’t be beat!</p>
<h1>Ingredients:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Potatoes (12oz)</li>    
    <li>Yellow Onion</li>    
    <li>Fresh Mozzarella</li>    
    <li>Mushroom Stock Concentrate</li>    
    <li>Button Mushrooms</li>    
    <li>Garlic (2 cloves)</li>
    <li>Dried Thyme</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Cooking Oil</li>
    <li>Mayo</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Peel and finely chop garlic. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms (skip this step if your mushrooms are pre-sliced!). Halve, peel, and finely dice half the onion (all for 4 servings). Thinly slice mozzarella into rounds.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on middle rack until golden brown and crispy, 20-25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine 2 TBSP mayonnaise (4 TBSP for 4 servings) and a pinch of garlic (you’ll use the rest later). Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring, until softened, 2 minutes. Add another drizzle of oil, mushrooms, ½ tsp dried thyme (1 tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper; cook, stirring, until veggies are browned and tender, 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add stock concentrate, remaining garlic, and 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and mixture is saucy, 3 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a medium bowl. Wash out pan.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Evenly spread half the bread slices with garlic mayo. Top with mushroom mixture, mozzarella, and remaining bread slices to form sandwiches. In pan used for veggies, melt 1 TBSP butter over medium-high heat. (For 4 servings, you may need to work in batches, adding more butter if needed.) Add sandwiches; cook, pressing down occasionally with a spatula, until bread is golden brown and cheese melts, 2-3 minutes per side. (Cover pan with a lid during the last minute of cooking for extra-melty cheese!) Transfer to a cutting board.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Halve panini on a diagonal. Divide panini between plates along with potato wedges. If you’ve got some on hand, serve with ketchup on the side for dipping.</li>
