<h1>Steps:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Peel and finely chop garlic. Drain and rinse chickpeas; pat dry with paper towels. Halve, peel, and cut onion into ½-inch-thick wedges; finely chop a wedge or two until you have 2 TBSP (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Zest and quarter lemon (for 4, zest one lemon and quarter both). Trim and halve cucumber lengthwise; cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick half-moons. Dice tomato.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in rice, stock concentrate, ¾ cup water, ½ tsp Tunisian Spice Blend, and a pinch of salt (for 4 servings, use 1½ cups water and 1 tsp Tunisian Spice Blend). Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
    <br>
    <li>While rice cooks, toss chickpeas and onion wedges on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, 2 tsp Tunisian Spice Blend (4 tsp for 4 servings; be sure to measure—we sent more), salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack, stirring halfway through, until chickpeas are crispy and onion wedges are tender, 18-20 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream with juice from two lemon wedges (four wedges for 4 servings). Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt to taste.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 tsp olive oil, ½ tsp sugar, and juice from remaining lemon. (For 4 servings, use 4 tsp olive oil and 1 tsp sugar.) Stir in chopped onion, cucumber, tomato, and half the cheese (save the rest for serving). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lemon zest and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Divide rice between bowls and top with roasted chickpeas and onion. Drizzle with as much creamy lemon sauce as you like. Add tomato cucumber salad to one side of each bowl and garnish with remaining cheese.
