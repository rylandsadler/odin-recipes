This is my second attempt at making a website with Odin Project. My last page was from a FFXIV cookbook. This time I'm using some recipes from Everyplate. My main hope with this is that I go through the Odin Project fully while attending classes for a BAS in CS, and get a job in the industry. After finishing this project for the second time after some years, I think I understand commit messages and the whole git process much better and it comes more naturally to me now. Also I remember the first one taking a alot longer, while this time was kind of a breeze. Still pretty ugly but I didn't try too hard.
